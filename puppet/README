* manifests/ should contain just those things that are specific to your site
  and shouldn't be used elsewhere, such as node definitions.

* Just about everything should be a self-contained module in the modules/
  directory.
  More information about the module directory structure can be found at
  http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/modules_fundamentals.html

* Common facter or puppet extensions ("plugins") should go in
  modules/common/lib.  This is so that pluginsync can find them. So
  modules/common may look like a module, but it contains no other module
  related files.
